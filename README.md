# Random Password Generator

A random password generator built using JavaScript. Paired with a basic HTML/CSS webpage.

## Motivation

I wanted to test myself in JavaScript and build a random password generator, similar to the one I built in Python.

## Why?

With python I wasn't sure how to create an interface for the generator. With my newly learned skills I decided to challenge myself.
